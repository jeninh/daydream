<h2>Sponsorship Opportunity:</h2>
<h3>Daydream Toronto Hackathon</h3>
<p>Dear (company) Team,</p>
<p>I hope this email finds you well. My name is (name), a (grade) student and member of Hack Club, a 401(c)(3) non-profit global open-source community for teenagers interested in coding and technical projects. We're organizing Daydream Toronto this year, and we would love to explore a sponsorship partnership with your company for our hackathon.</p>
<p>On September 27th, we're organizing Daydream Toronto, a 24-hour hackathon for over 100 teenagers across Toronto. We're seeking sponsors who believe in empowering the next generation of innovators.</p>
<p>Daydream is a beginner-friendly game jam, where teenagers collaborate to build games over 24 hours. It provides an opportunity for students to experience the joy of coding and creation in a fun, collaborative environment. This event is part of a larger global initiative, with hackathons running simultaneously in over 100 cities.</p>
<p>By sponsoring Daydream Toronto, your company would gain valuable exposure to 100+ tech-savvy teenagers and their families, while supporting STEM education in Toronto. We offer various sponsorship packages including logo placement, social media recognition, speaking opportunities, and direct access to emerging talent. Your support would help cover venue costs, meals, prizes, and equipment needed to create an inspiring environment for these young innovators.</p>
<p>Should you have any further questions about sponsorship opportunities, we'd be delighted to follow up with a detailed sponsorship packet or discuss this partnership over the phone or by email - whichever is more comfortable.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering supporting our young innovators, and we look forward to your favorable reply.</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br>(your name)<br>On behalf of the team behind Daydream Toronto</p>
